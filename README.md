# Course Description
This course presents the database design process practiced when creating a relational database; it also presents the relational database management system’s architecture as well as the fundamental ACID properties of a relational database management system. Extended entity-relationship models will be generated and represented using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation. SQL will be studied in detail. Relational algebra and its relationship to the SQL language will be presented. Advanced topics include triggers, stored procedures, indexing, and fundamentals of transactions, concurrency and recovery. The course will also include an introduction to NoSQL databases and provide students the opportunity to compare SQL to NoSQL. Students will define a database project that includes the design and implementation of a database as well as an application for interacting with the database.

## Prerequisites
While the course does not have specific prerequisites, students are expected to have reasonably strong experience in programming in at least one modern programming language such as C++, Java, Python, Visual Basic, or R. The actual programming language used in the course is set by the instructor and is commonly R. Some understanding of key concepts in computer science at the undergraduate level, including computer systems, operating systems, multi-threaded programming, networking, discrete mathematics, data structures, and algorithms, is presumed.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, the learner will be able to:

- Create an operational relational database from an analysis of a domain
- Express a data model using UML and ERD
- Write complex relational queries in SQL
- Construct analytical databases using star and snowflake schemas
- Abstract queries with relational algebra and domain relational calculus
- Build client/server applications using embedded SQL combined with stored procedures and triggers
- Understand the architecture of database engines including query planning and execution
- Define data storage infrastructures, including RAID
- Explain data storage solutions using partioning, sharding, and distribution
- Manage concurrent access to data using transactions and concurrency control protocols

## Optional Texts
The recommended textbook for this course is *Introduction to Database Systems* by ITL Education Solutions Limited, Pearson India, November 2008, ISBN: 9788131731925. This textbook is available at no cost to matriculated students at all Northeastern Campuses through the O’Reilly Learning portal.
