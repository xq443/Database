There are a total of **`r nrow(df.wines)`** wines in this dataset. **`r round(mean(df.wines$alcohol > 11) * 100, 1)`%** of the wines have an alcohol content over 11%. The highest alcohol content of any wine is **`r round(max(df.wines$alcohol), 1)`%**.

The scatter plot below illustrates the correlation between alcohol and sugar content.

```{r scatter_plot, fig.height=6}
# Calculate correlation first
correlation <- cor(df.wines$alcohol, df.wines$residual.sugar)

# Then create the plot
plot(
  df.wines$residual.sugar, df.wines$alcohol,
  main = "Sugar vs Alcohol Content",
  xlab = "Sugar",
  ylab = "Alcohol",
  col = adjustcolor("black", alpha.f = 0.3),
  pch = 19
)
